## Project Description

This folder contains required python codes to create prosumers profile and energy usage to be used in Electricity Market related codes and papers.Prosumers have flexible(shiftable) and inflexible(non-shiftable) loads.
Inflexible loads are generated based on this paper: [Domestic electricity use: A high-resolution energy demand model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778810001854)

Electric vehicles play a rule in consumption profile as one of the main research fields in smart grid technologies. Behavior of EVs and their consumption is generated based on this paper:
[Sizing of electric vehicle charging stations with smart charging capabilities and quality of service requirements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721001621)
